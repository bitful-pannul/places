Places is a mysterious map filled with markers, from frens. 
A fork of %rumors from ~paldev, it uses its `gossip.hoon` library to pass around data. 

A difference is that it uses react for the frontend instead of `lib/rudder.hoon` to serve up a native sail one. JSON conversion marks were written for the frontend to scry/poke the agent.  

Another is that places travel 3 hops instead of 2, which means that you might see markers on your map written in faraway lands...

If you want to test it locally, copy the files from `dev-desk` and `|start %pals`, `|start %places`.

A big thanks to `~wicrum-wicrun` for all the help, and `~palfun-faslup` for awesome tips and calling me based for aligning items with &nbps;
